/**
 * Feeds a database backup into a download the service worker is holding open.
 *
 * The worker end of a three-party relay: the service worker answers a download navigation with a
 * streamed `Response`, the page passes one end of a message channel through to this worker, and
 * this module pulls pages off the live database and pushes them down the channel. Nothing lands in
 * the origin's own storage on the way, which is the point: a quota that cannot hold a second copy
 * of the database never has to.
 *
 * The stream is pull-driven, which is what carries the browser's backpressure all the way here:
 * the service worker asks for a chunk each time the download can take more, so a slow disk slows
 * the database reads rather than piling chunks up in a message queue.
 *
 * The payload is always a container, encrypted when a passphrase is given and plain otherwise, and
 * either way its trailer carries a digest over what was written. Nothing is ever written back to,
 * which is what lets a destination like this one hold the format at all. Compression is never used
 * here, at these sizes it is more than a low-end device can afford, and leaving it off is also what
 * keeps the size exact: that is what gives the download its `Content-Length` and its progress bar.
 *
 * Protocol, from the service worker's side: it receives `begin` (with the exact byte size), then
 * one `chunk` per `pull` it sends, then `end`; `error` may arrive at any point, and `cancel` may
 * be sent at any point.
