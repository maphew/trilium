/**
 * Builds the access-token provider the importer calls before every Graph request.
 *
 * A large or heavily-throttled import runs far longer than a Microsoft Graph access token lives
 * (~60–90 min), and a single throttled request can wait out most of that on its own. Passing one token
 * captured at the start would leave every request past the expiry boundary failing with 401 — which,
 * with the per-page hardening, degrades the import into a tree of placeholder notes and then trips the
 * circuit breaker. So instead of a fixed string the importer holds this provider and re-reads a token
 * from it on each attempt: it hands back the current token while it is valid and transparently refreshes
 * (persisting the rotated token) as expiry approaches.
