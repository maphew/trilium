/**
 * Permission allowlists per session kind. Unset handlers make Electron GRANT
 * every request, so anything not listed here (camera, microphone, MIDI, HID,

 *
 * - `app`: the default session — the Trilium renderer itself. It legitimately
 *   writes to the clipboard (copy note content/links), toggles fullscreen
 *   (e.g. presentations, zen mode) and shows notifications (user scripts
 *   commonly call `new Notification()` for reminders; the renderer only runs
 *   trusted code, so this stays available to the scripting ecosystem).
 *   Clipboard *read* stays denied on purpose: the renderer reads via the
 *   main-process `electronApi.clipboard.readText()` bridge, so the sensitive
 *   `clipboard-read` permission never has to be granted to the whole session
 *   (which would also expose it to embedded remote iframes).
 *   `fileSystem` covers the File System Access API, which bundled third-party
 *   editors call directly rather than through `electronApi` — the Excalidraw
 *   canvas reaches `showOpenFilePicker()` / `showSaveFilePicker()` via
 *   `browser-fs-access` to insert an image or export a drawing. Chromium only
 *   hands out a handle for a file the user picked in an OS dialog, so the grant
 *   cannot reach anything the user did not choose.
 *   `local-fonts` lets the appearance settings offer the fonts installed on
 *   this device (see `listSystemFonts`); Chromium routes it through the
 *   *check* handler rather than the request handler, so granting it here is
 *   what keeps the picker from falling back to the stock list.
 *   `geolocation` lets the geo map's locate button ask where this device is
 *   (see `useGeolocate` in the client). Chromium prompts for nothing
 *   of its own in Electron, so this grant is the only gate; the origin check
 *   below keeps it from remote embeds, and MapLibre probes the *check*
 *   handler before it enables the button at all.
 * - `guest`: the `<webview>` partition hosting arbitrary remote pages from
 *   Web View notes. Fullscreen only (embedded video players) — a remote page
 *   must not show OS notifications that appear to come from Trilium.
 *
 * The `app` allowlist is gated by request origin (see
 * {@link isPermissionAllowedForOrigin}): only the `trilium-app://app` shell
 * gets clipboard-write / notifications, not remote `<iframe>` embeds that share
 * the default session. Fullscreen is the exception — granted for any origin.

 * skips the process launch and reuses the scripts the opener has already
 * compiled. `overrideBrowserWindowOptions` takes precedence over the call's
 * `features` string, so a page cannot loosen `webPreferences` through it, and
 * `outlivesOpener` keeps the child open after its opener closes, like a

 *

 * payload, so Follina-class (`ms-msdt:`) and credential-leak (`smb:`) URLs
 * must not bypass it here.
