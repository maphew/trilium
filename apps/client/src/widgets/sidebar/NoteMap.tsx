/**
 * The card is rendered here and the map itself loaded on demand from within it, rather than the whole
 * widget being loaded on demand from the pane: the lazy wrapper is a `display: contents` element, which
 * leaves no box but is still an element as far as selectors are concerned, so a card behind it is no
 * longer a child of the tab body and misses everything the pane styles by that relation — its dividing
 * border, the first card's header padding, the sharing out of the tab's height.
 *
 * Which map to draw is asked here too, rather than in the map's own floating overlay: a card of the
 * pane keeps its controls in its header, and a map this small has little room to stand buttons over.
 * The map reads the same option, so the two stay of one mind without being told.
 *
 * It is the one card of the tab that grows, taking whatever room the lists below it leave over — a
 * map is worth whatever height it is given, and there is no height at which it is finished being
 * read, which is true of none of the lists. Where it stops being squeezed is in NoteMap.css.

                    on to a tab. What it opens is this card's own map — nothing else opens that view, so it
                    is drawn in `expanded` mode and left showing the map being expanded, rather than
                    whichever one the note itself asks for.

                    The popup rather than a split, because a map that sits beside the note
                    being read looks as though it follows it and doesn't; a glance that goes away when it
                    has sent the reader somewhere makes no such promise. */}
