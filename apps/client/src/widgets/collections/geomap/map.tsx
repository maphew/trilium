/**
 * Carries whatever was put on the outgoing style over to the incoming one.
 *
 * A style is a world of its own, and switching one takes every source and layer on the map with it —
 * including those that were never the style's to begin with. The markers and the GPX tracks live on
 * the style because a map has nowhere else to put them, so switching between a light and a dark map
 * took every marker off it and put them back only once the new style had loaded, which is a network
 * away. Handed over here instead, they are part of the incoming style before it is ever applied, and
 * so are never off the map at all.
 *
 * What was added is what the outgoing style has and the style we applied did not, which is why the
 * latter has to be known: everything else in the outgoing style is the old map itself, and carrying
 * that over would leave it drawn on top of the new one. The additions go last, so they stay above
 * the map rather than under it.
 *
 * An addition that drew from the outgoing style's *own* source is the exception, and is dropped
 * rather than handed on: there is nothing to hand it: see the note where that is decided below.
 *
 * Note that the images a layer draws with are not part of a style and do not come across (see
 * `Markers`, which puts them back on `style.load`) — and that MapLibre applies this whether it can
 * turn one style into the other or has to build the new one from scratch, so nothing here depends on
 * which of the two it chooses.
 *
 * @param applied the style this map was last given, or `undefined` where it is not known. Nothing
 *                is carried over then, and the additions are put back on `style.load` instead.
