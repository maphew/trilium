 * A map opened at the stock view stands over an ocean, and its notes are found by panning until

 * Framing them is what the reader would do by hand, done once and saved as any other view is.
 *
 * Only where `enabled`, which the view above passes as "no view has been saved": where one has, it
 * is where the reader put the map and is never overruled. Only once per map besides, so a note
 * gaining a place while the map is open cannot pull the camera off wherever the reader has since
 * moved it.
 *
 * The framing is a camera move like any other, so the `moveend` behind it saves the view — the next
 * open reads it back rather than working it out again.
 *
 * A component rather than an effect in the view above, so the map is read from the context every
 * other layer reads it from. Nothing is drawn.
