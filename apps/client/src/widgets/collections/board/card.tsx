/**
 * Memoized because a board holds hundreds of these and most redraws change none of them: a drag
 * moves one card, and the rest receive the same props they already had.
 *
 * This only works because a card reads nothing from the board's drag-state context -- Preact
 * re-renders a context consumer whatever its memo boundary says, so subscribing there would make
 * the comparison below unreachable. `isEditing` and `isDragging` arrive as props for that reason.
 *
 * `api` keeps one identity for as long as the board is mounted, so a refresh reaches only the cards
 * whose own props changed. Anything a card reads off the api while rendering has to arrive as a prop
 * instead, which is why `statusAttribute` is one.
