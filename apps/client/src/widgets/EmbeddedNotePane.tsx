 * PromotedAttributes, NoteDetail), and, in EmbeddedNotePane.css, the layout that fits them into a

/**
 * A note context of the pane's own, pointed at whichever note the pane stands for — the arrangement
 * the quick editor makes, so that the icon and title widgets work and a rename saves the usual way.
 *
 * One context for the pane rather than one per note: moving between notes is a note switch within a
 * standing pane, not a new pane.
 *
 * The returned component stands between the host view's component and the pane's contents. The
 * context was built here rather than by the tab manager, so it has no parent to raise events
 * through and is given one by hand — the pane's component, not the host's. Pointing a note context
 * at a note announces a note switch, and an unbound `useNoteContext` rebinds to whatever context it
 * hears named (see hooks.tsx). The quick editor gets away with announcing to its parent because it
 * is a dialog at the root; the pane is inside its view, so the collection view around it would
 * rebind to the pane's note and tear the view down. It still hangs off the host's component as a
 * child, so app-wide events travel down into the pane — a component hanging off nothing would never
 * hear that its note was edited elsewhere.
