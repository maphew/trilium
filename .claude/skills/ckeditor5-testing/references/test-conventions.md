# Trilium test conventions & gotchas

Trilium never used Karma/Mocha/Sinon — the plugin tests are Vitest from the start, so there is no
migration to do. This reference collects the Trilium-specific conventions and traps when writing
CKEditor 5 plugin tests.

## The environment: Playwright browser mode

`packages/ckeditor5` runs its tests in **real headless Chromium** via
`@vitest/browser-playwright`, so layout, `getBoundingClientRect()`, `elementFromPoint()` and
pointer events all behave as they do in a browser. Both gate `src/**` at 100% coverage.

Trilium used to run some plugins on happy-dom. Nothing does now, but the difference matters when
porting an older test:

- happy-dom returned **zeros** from layout APIs, so measurement-dependent code appeared to work
  while never really being exercised.
- happy-dom dispatched some events **synchronously** that a real browser defers. `<details>` fires
  `toggle` on a later task, for instance, so assert after awaiting the event rather than straight
  after the click.
- Synthetic events need `cancelable: true` for `preventDefault()` to have any effect. Without it,
  native behaviour (a `<summary>` toggling, say) still runs and the test reads as a product bug.

## Real-editor lifecycle & teardown

There are **no** upstream test-editor factories (`ModelTestEditor` etc.) in Trilium — tests build a
real `ClassicEditor` over a real element with `licenseKey: 'GPL'`. In the aggregate
(`packages/ckeditor5`), the shared kit does this for you: `createTestEditor()` from
`test/editor-kit.ts` creates and **tracks** the editor, and the global `afterEach` in
`test/setup.ts` (wired via `setupFiles`) destroys every tracked editor and removes its host element.
So aggregate specs no longer write an editor-teardown `afterEach`:

```ts
import { createTestEditor } from '../../test/editor-kit.js';

beforeEach( async () => {
	editor = await createTestEditor( [ Paragraph, MyPlugin ] );
} );
// no afterEach for the editor — setup.ts tears it down
```

The host element is `editor.sourceElement` (or `getEditorElement( editor )` from the kit). The
standalone packages (and legacy specs mid-migration to the kit) still hand-roll create + an
`afterEach` calling `editor.destroy()` and `editorElement.remove()`; forgetting either there leaks
editor DOM / body wrappers across tests and causes flakiness.

**Globals: use the kit's installers.** Stub the Trilium `glob` / `navigator.clipboard` via
`installGlobMock()` / `mockClipboard()` from `test/globals-test-kit.ts` — they register their own
teardown (run by `setup.ts`), and `$` is a global passthrough from `setup.ts`. Don't hand-roll
`globalThis.glob` + a manual `delete`; browser mode's shared page leaks a forgotten global into
later specs (see `patterns.md`).

## Assertion styles — both work

Vitest accepts **Jest-style** and **Chai-style** matchers, and the existing Trilium tests mix
them freely. Use whichever fits; don't "convert" one to the other for its own sake.

| Chai-style | Jest-style |
|------------|------------|
| `expect( x ).to.equal( y )` | `expect( x ).toBe( y )` |
| `expect( x ).to.deep.equal( y )` | `expect( x ).toEqual( y )` |
| `expect( x ).to.be.true` / `.false` | `expect( x ).toBe( true )` / `toBe( false )` |
| `expect( x ).to.instanceOf( C )` | `expect( x ).toBeInstanceOf( C )` |
| `expect( x ).to.throw( /re/ )` | `expect( x ).toThrow( /re/ )` |

There are **no** custom matchers (`equalMarkup`, `.attribute`) — compare stringified model/view
directly: `expect( _getModelData( model ) ).toEqual( '<paragraph>…</paragraph>' )`.

## Helpers & imports

- Import `_setModelData`, `_getModelData`, `_getViewData` (and editor classes, `keyCodes`, etc.)
  from `'ckeditor5'`. In-package source imports use a file extension (`../src/foo.js`).
- Spies/mocks via `vi` (`vi.spyOn` / `vi.fn` / `vi.useFakeTimers`).
- Test-file location: **co-located `*.spec.ts`** in `packages/ckeditor5`, including inside plugin
  folders (`include: ['src/**/*.spec.ts']`).

## Running the browser-mode packages

`ckeditor5` runs **sequentially** at the root (`pnpm test:sequential`) because
each spins up headless Chrome and they exhaust resources in parallel. Everything else runs via
`pnpm test:parallel`. For a single package, use `pnpm --filter @triliumnext/ckeditor5 test` (or
`...-math`).

## See also

For general (non-CKEditor) Trilium testing — Preact components, jQuery widgets, client services,
server routes — use the `writing-unit-tests` skill, which also documents when to reach for
`@vitest/browser` rather than the default happy-dom environment those tests use.
