/**
 * What the standalone build exposes to the client as `window.standaloneApi`.
 *
 * Standalone runs the whole stack in the browser: the database lives in a worker's private
 * filesystem, and the client talks to it over an intercepted `fetch`. That path serialises every
 * request body twice on its way through, and gives up after thirty seconds, which is fine for the
 * JSON everything else exchanges and impossible for a database.
 *
 * So the few things that carry a file get their own way through, the same way the desktop's
 * `window.electronApi` does. A `File` handed across is a reference to bytes the browser already has;
 * nothing is copied, nothing is uploaded, and the worker reads it as a stream.
