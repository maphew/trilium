/**
 * The media types Trilium handles as pictures, shared by the two places that decide it.
 *
 * The upload endpoints gate on this to choose between storing an image (an `image`-role attachment
 * or an image note, addressed by an `api/attachments/.../image/...` URL) and storing an opaque file
 * (addressed by a `#root/...?viewMode=attachments` reference). The rich text editor gates on the
 * same thing to choose between inserting a picture and handing the file to the file-upload plugin.
 *
 * Those two used to be separate lists, and every type they disagreed about was a defect:
 *
 * - Claimed by the editor but not by the endpoint, the editor inserts an image element, uploads,
 *   and assigns whatever comes back as its source without looking at it — so the file branch's
 *   `#root/...` reference ended up in an `<img src>`, drawing a permanently broken picture.
 * - Accepted by the endpoint but not claimed by the editor, the file-upload plugin builds a
 *   reference link out of it and points it at the image URL the endpoint answered with, which is
 *   not a note URL, so it renders as "[missing note]".
 *
 * Keeping one list means neither can happen. Consult it through {@link isAcceptedImageMime} where a
 * media type is in hand, and through {@link IMAGE_UPLOAD_SUBTYPES} where the editor's config wants
 * bare subtypes.
