 * row updated and a change recorded. On its own that is a small transaction; eight hundred of them
 * back to back is gigabytes of pages through the write-ahead log, a commit and a flush each, and
 * the checkpoints that follow. None of that stops the process, which is what makes it confusing to
 * watch: the application keeps answering while the database it shares stops being available to
 * anything else, the note holding the log included.
 *
 * Grouping them changes none of the writing and almost all of the committing.
 *
 * Flushed when the group is full *or* when one has been waiting: without the second, the last few
 * images of a run would sit in a batch that never fills, and the run waits on them — which is a
 * deadlock rather than a delay.
