/**

 * of the import (the note the client activates afterwards). OPML reports a structured failure as a
 * `[httpStatus, message]` array instead of throwing.
 *
 * Shared by the HTTP import route and the desktop native import handler so both resolve a file to an
 * importer identically. The caller owns the surrounding CLS setup (`disableEntityEvents`,
 * `ignoreEntityChangeIds`) and the `becca_loader.load()` afterwards.
 *
 * A `.zip` is read from `file.path` in place (streamed per entry) when present, falling back to
 * `file.buffer` for the browser/WASM upload that has no temp file.
