/**
 * Fetching the pictures a note's content names at a third party, and keeping them as its own.
 *
 * Note content arrives from places that reference pictures by URL rather than carrying them: a page
 * pasted from a browser, a clipping, an export from another app. Left alone those references keep
 * the note dependent on someone else's server — every reader fetches from it, and the picture
 * disappears the day the URL rots. So the bytes are fetched once, stored as attachments of the note,
 * and the references rewritten to point at them.
 *
 * Governed throughout by `downloadImagesAutomatically`: fetching is the note reaching out to a third
 * party on the reader's behalf, which is the user's decision rather than ours.
 *
 * A picture carried *inline*, as a base64 `data:` URI, is moved out here for the same reasons minus
 * the fetch: base64 costs a third more than the bytes it encodes, is copied into every revision of
 * the note, and repeats in full for each place the same picture appears.
 *
 * Two shapes of reference are handled, and {@link storePictureBytes} is the step they share — give
 * it bytes and it answers with the attachment URL that references them.

 *
 * - **named at a third party**, which is what a Notion export ships — the origin's addresses and no
 *   bytes at all. Fetching them is the note reaching out on the reader's behalf, so it is governed
 *   by `downloadImagesAutomatically`, the same setting that decides whether a remote `<img>` in note
 *   content is fetched. They belong to that question and were only ever outside it by accident: they
 *   arrive in an export as ordinary `<img>` elements and become attributes when the importer
 *   rewrites the card, which took them out of the pass that would have handled them.
 * - **carried inline**, as a base64 `data:` URI. Our own single-file export writes them that way (it
 *   has nowhere else to put them), as did every preview made before the pictures became attachments.
 *   Nothing is fetched to unpack one, so the setting above has no say — the bytes are already here,
 *   and the only question is whether they sit in the content or beside it.
 *
 * Both are worth undoing, for the same reason the pictures became attachments in the first place. An
 * inline picture is base64 in the note's content, a third again larger than the bytes it encodes,
 * duplicated into every revision of the note and reread on every load. A site linked a dozen times
 * inlines its icon a dozen times; stored under a deduplicating role, those dozen become one.
